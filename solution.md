Solution:
  Develop a program where students and instructors/peers could write code at the same time. There will be an access related roles, and the instructors will have the
 highest role, "administrator" and the students will have a lower role, "member". In the case of student and instructor, the program will allow instructors 
 to see individual student's screen, monitoring their progress and checking if they need help. Not only this, but also the instructors will be able to fix any errors
 that students make while writing their code. The students will also be able to privately ask the instructor questions if any arise during the coding process. The 
 questions will be asked and answered on a one-on-one basis since some students may feel embarrassed to ask their questions. For the peer to peer case, all of the peers 
 in the group can have the "administrator" role and have access to everythingthe program offers. The peers will be able to work on the same project live time, editing 
 and reviewing the code together. They will also have the same functionalities as the students do when they are working with instructors.
