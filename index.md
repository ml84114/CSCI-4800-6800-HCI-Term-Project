# Synchronous collaborative programming 

## Project for CSCI 4800/6800 Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

### Collaborators:
1. Ehsan Latif (ehsan.latif@uga.edu)
2. Afsaneh Shams (as14847@uga.edu)
3. Jerel Harris (jkh11360@uga.edu)

### Problem of Study
Live coding for the sake of cooperative learning without proper collaboration can lead to code cramming without understanding. Collaborative writing without history and log maintenance can cause a lack of transparency and poor engagement of collaborators.
